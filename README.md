## 📖 Overview

**PEDAL-256** (Pedestal Elastomeric Dense Array Link) is an open-source, solderless, and scalable pedestal connector system designed for high-density chronic neural recording. It provides a mechanically robust and electrically reliable interface between thin-film implanted neural probes and external headstages, with a form factor optimized for freely moving animal studies.

> [!TIP]
> **Key Innovation:** The system integrates a high-density interposer PCB, an anisotropic elastomeric contact interface, and a lightweight pedestal housing into a fully integrated, headstage-ready solution.
