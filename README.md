## 📖 Overview

**PEDAL-256** (Pedestal Elastomeric Dense Array Link) is an open-source, solderless, and scalable pedestal connector system designed for high-density chronic neural recording. It provides a mechanically robust and electrically reliable interface between thin-film implanted neural probes and external headstages, with a form factor optimized for freely moving animal studies.

> [!TIP]
> **Key Innovation:** The system integrates a high-density interposer PCB, an anisotropic elastomeric contact interface, and a lightweight pedestal housing into a fully integrated, headstage-ready solution.

## ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ 256-Channel High-Density Interface**
    Compact pedestal footprint supporting high-density acquisition without increasing surgical overhead.
* **🔌 Solderless Elastomeric Interconnect**
    Uses anisotropic conductive elastomer for repeatable, alignment-tolerant electrical contact.
* **🐭 Optimized for In-Vivo Research**
   Minimal Implant Footprint Core components weigh only 2.8g (with housing removed), reducing head-heavy behavior and improving animal welfare during long-term recording sessions.
* **🛠️ Modular & Scalable**
    Separable housing, PCB, and protective cap for rapid iteration and troubleshooting.
* **🧪 Surgical-Grade Design**
    Textured sidewalls for superior adhesion with dental cement or UV-curable resin.
