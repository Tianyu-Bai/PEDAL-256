📖 Overview

PEDAL-256 (Pedestal Elastomeric Dense Array Link) is an open-source, solderless, and scalable pedestal connector system designed for high-density chronic neural recording.
It provides a mechanically robust and electrically reliable interface between thin-film implanted neural probes and external headstages, with a form factor optimized for freely moving animal studies.

The system integrates a high-density interposer PCB, an anisotropic elastomeric contact interface, and a lightweight pedestal housing into a fully integrated, headstage-ready solution.
PEDAL-256 is validated for 256-channel acquisition and architected to support future scaling toward higher channel counts without increasing the volumetric footprint.

The design has been optimized for rats and non-human primates, prioritizing minimal implant mass, mechanical stability, and long-term durability under behavioral conditions.

✨ Key Features

256-Channel High-Density Interface
Compact pedestal footprint supporting up to 256 recording channels.

Solderless Elastomeric Interconnect
Anisotropic conductive elastomer enables repeatable, alignment-tolerant electrical contact without soldering.

Headstage-Ready Integration
Direct compatibility with Intan RHD-series headstages and commutator-based freely moving setups.

Lightweight Mechanical Design
Total assembled mass of approximately 6.4 g, minimizing skull torque during chronic implantation.

Surgical-Grade Pedestal Housing
Textured sidewalls and anchoring features for secure fixation using dental cement or UV-curable resin.

Modular Architecture
Mechanical housing, interposer PCB, and protective cap are separable for rapid iteration, testing, and replacement.
