## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the mechanical and electrical design files for a high-density **Pedestal Connector** customized for chronic neural recording applications. The design serves as the interface between implanted neural probes and external headstages.

The system is optimized for Rats/Non-Human Primates, focusing on minimizing implant weight and maximizing structural integrity during behavioral experiments.

## ✨ Key Features

* **High Channel Density:** Supports up to 256 channels in a compact footprint.
* **Headstage Compatibility:** Designed to mate perfectly with Intan RHD standard controllers.
* **Lightweight Construction:** Total assembly weight is approximately **6.4 g**, minimizing torque on the skull.
* **Surgical Integration:** Features textured sidewalls and anchor points for secure adhesion with dental cement or UV-curable resin.
* **Modular Design:** Separates the PCB interposer from the structural housing for easier testing and replacement.
